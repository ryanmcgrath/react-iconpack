The icons here are all the Polymer icons (24px variant) from the Polymer project
on GitHub (https://github.com/Polymer/). To the best of my knowledge, as long as
I am including the license (which is inside this folder in the package) this should
be considered appropriate use.

If not, please feel free to contact me and I'll gladly update it or something.
